The two components of the registered word mark are the word 'FEVICOL' and the word ‘MARINE' which are arranged side by side. Both these words are in the same font and of the same size and are therefore of equal prominence. At B, the registered word mark 'FEVICOL MARINE' is set out.

The dictionary meaning “of or relating to the sea” does not in any manner describe the products of the Plaintiff/Defendant or the characteristics of the products of the Plaintiff/Defendant. The word 'MARINE' is not descriptive of the products of the Plaintiff/Defendant. The Defendant has also relied on the meaning of the word 'MARINE GLUE' as “glue that is not water soluble”. The word 'MARINE GLUE' finds no mention in the Oxford Dictionary, but only in an online dictionary, the author, veracity or acceptance of which is not known and which is neither a widely accepted nor a renowned dictionary as the Oxford Dictionary. Added to this, as stated hereinabove, the fact that the Defendant itself applied for registration of the same as a trademark, inherent in which is the admission that 'MARINE' is distinctive and in any event capable of distinguishing the products of one person from those of another and is capable of being registered as a trademark. The contention of the Defendant that the word 'MARINE' is a common, customary term, generic, laudatory or non\\xaddistinctive mark within the meaning of Section 9 (c ) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (“the Act”) in relation to “waterproof adhesives” cannot be\",\n",

The grant of registration was challenged before the High Court in a rectification petition. The subject matter of the challenge in the proceedings before this Court was the validity and/or correctness of the registration granted. It is as a part of this inquiry that the Court considered whether the word 'Gutsy' could be registered i.e. whether it was capable of distinguishing goods of the trader or of a non distinctive character. The same inquiry was done in the case of Joseph Crosfield. This inquiry cannot be made or be gone into in the present case. The present action is one of infringement. The correctness of the registration has been conceded. The Registry has held that the marks in question (whose registration has been granted) are fit to be registered.

This further reinforces the Plaintiff's submission that it is using the word 'MARINE' as a mark and not in a descriptive sense. It is correctly submitted on behalf of the Plaintiff that had the word ‘MARINE' being used in a descriptive sense, there was no need or warrant to add the description “Waterproof Adhesive” as has been done by the Plaintiff.

The case of the Defendant that the use of 'MARINE PLUS' is to indicate to the customers that its product is “heat and water proof” is contrary to its own case that 'MARINE' means “of or relating to the sea” and not “heat and water proof”. Furthermore, the product of the Defendant depicted at Exhibit\\xadE to the reply at page 80, specifically bears the legend “Heat & water proof adhesive” and hence the use of 'MARINE PLUS' to communicate the same to the customer was not even necessary. The Defendant is obviously using 'MARINE PLUS' as a trademark and not in the descriptive sense. Since the Defendant is using 'MARINE'/ 'MARINE PLUS' as a trademark, Sections 35 and 30 (2) of the Act cannot be resorted to. In any event, the additional requirement of bona fide use is lacking for the purpose of Section 35. The defence sought to be raised is clearly an afterthought. The Defendant has admitted that 'JIVANJOR MARINE PLUS' ( and in effect 'MARINE PLUS' which is a leading and essential feature thereof) has been adopted and is being used as a trademark by the Defendant.\",\n",

       " \"In other words, the statute does not grant protection (exclusivity) over such parts or constituents of a composite mark, which are ‘common to the trade' or of a ‘non\\xaddistinctive character';\",\n",

Consequently, by reason of Section 17 (2) (b), the Plaintiff cannot claim any exclusivity;\",\n",
       " \"The Plaintiff's reliance on the fact that the Registrar whilst granting registration, did not impose a condition or limitation (qua the word 'MARINE') is of no assistance, since the provisions relating to “disclaimer” (existing in the 1958 Act) have been deleted in the 1999 Act.

The submission relating to disclaimer by the Defendant is therefore of no substance.',\n",

As a part of this evaluation process, the Court is required to determine what is/are the prominent and/or essential features of the mark taken as a whole. The protection and/or exclusivity will be conferred on these features and not on insignificant trivia. This Court has therefore at the outset after considering the relevant factors prima facie come to the conclusion that the word 'MARINE' forms a prominent and/or essential feature of the registered trademark (considered as a whole) . If the Defendant's arguments are accepted, the consequences will be startling. Composite marks will become useless. The same will be infringed with impunity by the simple expedient of using a trademark which has, as its essential or prominent feature(s), the essential and prominent feature of the registered mark with the addition of other matter. The mandate of Section 17 (1 ) will be totally frustrated.\",\n",

The word 'MARINE PLUS' is not descriptive, and in any event is not used by the Defendant as a bona fide description of the character of the product of the Defendant. The case of the Defendant that the use of 'MARINE PLUS' is to indicate to the customers that its product is “heat and water proof” is contrary to its own case that 'MARINE' means “of or relating to the sea” and not “heat and water proof”. Furthermore, the product of the Defendant depicted at Exhibit\\xadE to the reply at page 80, specifically bears the legend “Heat & water proof adhesive” and hence the use of 'MARINE PLUS' to communicate the same to the customer was not even necessary.

The two components of the registered word mark are the word 'FEVICOL' and the word ‘MARINE' which are arranged side by side.

The grant of registration was challenged before the High Court in a rectification petition. The subject matter of the challenge in the proceedings before this Court was the validity and/or correctness of the registration granted. It is as a part of this inquiry that the Court considered whether the word 'Gutsy' could be registered i.e. whether it was capable of distinguishing goods of the trader or of a non distinctive character. The same inquiry was done in the case of Joseph Crosfield. This inquiry cannot be made or be gone into in the present case. The present action is one of infringement. The correctness of the registration has been conceded. The Registry has held that the marks in question (whose registration has been granted) are fit to be registered. They have been found to be: (i) capable of distinguishing the goods of one trader;\",\n",

The submission relating to disclaimer by the Defendant is therefore of no substance.',\n",

As a part of this evaluation process, the Court is required to determine what is/are the prominent and/or essential features of the mark taken as a whole. The protection and/or exclusivity will be conferred on these features and not on insignificant trivia. This Court has therefore at the outset after considering the relevant factors prima facie come to the conclusion that the word 'MARINE' forms a prominent and/or essential feature of the registered trademark (considered as a whole) . If the Defendant's arguments are accepted, the consequences will be startling. Composite marks will become useless. The same will be infringed with impunity by the simple expedient of using a trademark which has, as its essential or prominent feature(s), the essential and prominent feature of the registered mark with the addition of other matter.
