original Problem

-> Making computers understand Language and interacting with humans.

-> at this point of time computers can not really see and imagine the visuals of it's surroundings.this will lead to a misunderstanding
   and ambiguity in the interaction.

-> what we can do to rectify the misunderstanding and ambiguity in the interaction ?.
    we can use NLP at large scale machine learning or deep learning to process the data and tag the token of words to represent a set of 
    situations or context or things in the order of it's probability.
    we need to build a neural network(not that of Math concept based NN, but a real human like NN)
