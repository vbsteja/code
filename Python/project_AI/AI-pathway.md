1. An Agent who can do the following tasks can be said to be artificially intelligent. an agent can be a computer program or a robot.

	a. Search (classical,adversarial).
	b. Logic(conditional/constraint, first order logic).
	c. planning (classical/modern) and acting in real world.
	d. knowledge representation.
	e. Reasoning(Probabilistic/deterministic over time).
	f. Decision Making(simple/complex).
	g. Learning(Machine Learning/Deep Learning with Neural nets,knowledge in learning,learning probabilistic models).
	h. Natural Language Processing.
	i. Natural Language Understanding.
	j. Reinforcement Learning.
	k. Perception 
	l. Robotics/mechanics.
	m. Mathematics/Physics(Quantum Computing)/Neuro science/Physiology/biology.
