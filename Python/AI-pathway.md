### To reach AI we need the following things:

1. An Agent who can do the following tasks can be said to be artificially intelligent. an agent can be a computer program or a robot.

	* Search (classical,adversarial).
	* Logic(conditional/constraint, first order logic).
	* planning (classical/modern) and acting in real world.
	* knowledge representation.
	* Reasoning(Probabilistic/deterministic over time).
	* Decision Making(simple/complex).
	* Learning(Machine Learning/Deep Learning with Neural nets,knowledge in learning,learning probabilistic models).
	* Natural Language Processing.
	* Natural Language Understanding.
	* Reinforcement Learning.
	* Perception 
	* Robotics/mechanics.
	* Mathematics/Physics(Quantum Computing)/Neuro science/Physiology/biology.
