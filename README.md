Phase 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    build a prototype of Arco , which could perform the simple things like opening and closing a program, sending mail, searching a file
    setting alarm, googling for text, estimating date and time in future.

Technologies to build Phase-1 of Arco:
    Server written in elixir running on Erlang VM.
    tasks are not yet divided for which language will perform what kind of operations.
    as of now, Python for integrating the system, automation, speech synthesis,prototype the agorithms in intiail stages,before rewriting
    in other languages such as haskell,scala,clojure.
    now the Arco will run on a single machine, it can scale to multiple machines if there is need.
    the prototype of arco is inspired by Human Brain model, tasks will be performed by the smallest part of Arco is neuron.

--> Arco is basically a Artificial Consciousness.
--> It can act as if it has knowledge about things, and events, context and which ever is possible to teach by humans.
--> The communication is basically with ARCO is like wih humans, we can text it, we can talk to it.
--> How ARCO understand Human laguage?  
    we are going to program NLP(Natural language Processing) in Arco.(english is initial Lang)
--> How ARCO will relates and acts? 
    like the Human Brain, ARCO is a combination of Millions of Neurons(Smallest Processor which,which process each of the smallest
    possible tasks.whenever a task is being entered inside the Arco, the task being in the form of the human readable language,
    like the Natural language. the task will be processed and generate a knowledge base which can be used to perform tasks. 
--> how Data being represented in Arco?
    Data is stored in JSON Format in (Temporary, may be i could found a better Format to store and represent data)
    Like in english data will be formed using letters, Words,Numbers, and symbols of all sorts, which can be represented 
    in computer storage. 
--> Reasoning. how ARCO is going to implemen that?
    as everything is related in this world.the relation is generally, a having, or is, or heirarichal relation. 
    a relation is multidomensional, it can be comparision relation, part of relation, heirarichal relation,
    the first thing to be remembered about arco is it wont do anything out of the box.we have to teach things how to do.
    for example you can trust ARCO to store your favourite things, list of names, what ever you throw at it. pretty much like learn
    and act.ARCO will have reasoning alogirthms, which are mainly based on the Relations. (currently i dont want to give reasoning 
    capabilities to ARCO, it will only be like pretty much of a non intelligent, who dont reason about, but will do what we want 
    him to do

Phase 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
if Phase 1 is successful, think about phase 2.
